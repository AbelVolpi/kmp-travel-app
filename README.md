## üõ† Architecture

This app was developed using the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)
architecture pattern and following
the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
concepts.

Currently, the structure of the system is as follows:

As a second step, is in progress improve the architecture to save the app data locally using Realm,
so the app can be used offline and we can save network resources:

## üìù Commits pattern

In this project we are using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/6.4/dev/git-commit-msg.html) commit convention to keep project readability.

## üîç Static Code Analysis
We are using [Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) to standardize Kotlin code, to check, run:
```
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```
And to format, run:
```
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```
All rules you can find in `.editorconfig` file.
